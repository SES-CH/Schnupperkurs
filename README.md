> Small Esperanto course held and to be held at various c3 events.
> 
> As there are quite some parallelisms between the worldwide Esperanto community
> and the worldwide hacker scene, there are usually some Esperanto speakers
> attending the big Chaos events.  Oftentimes we are two of them.
> 
> Of course we cannot give a comprehensive course about Esperanto, but a few
> insights to the language and its community first hand.
